            <h3>Lodging</h3>
            <p>
                Taniti has a wide variety of lodging that ranges from an inexpensive hostel to one large, four-star resort. There are many small, family-owned hotels and a growing number of bed and breakfasts. All types of lodging are strictly regulated and regularly inspected by the Tanitian government.

            <h3>Transportation</h3>
            <p>
                Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.
